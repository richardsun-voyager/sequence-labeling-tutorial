All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-positive

great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-negative
) O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-positive
Eye I-positive
. O

Great O
food B-positive
with O
an O
awesome O
atmosphere B-positive
! O

The O
sangria B-positive
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Also O
, O
waiters B-negative
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$ O
. O

The O
restaurant B-neutral
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2 O
+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ain't O
bad O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-positive
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-positive
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
menu B-positive
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-neutral
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

The O
entire O
staff B-positive
was O
extremely O
accomodating O
and O
tended O
to O
my O
every O
need O
. O

food B-negative
was O
luke O
warm O
. O

Excellent O
food B-positive
, O
although O
the O
interior B-negative
could O
use O
some O
help O
. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

Dinners B-positive
have O
always O
been O
excellent O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
quality O
. O

The O
dinner O
only O
took O
us O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
alright O
for O
the O
strip O
, O
almost O
$ O
50 O
/ O
pp O
after O
tax O
and O
tip O
( O
about O
average O
) O
. O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-positive
was O
great O
! O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O

) O
. O

Have O

years O
and O
the O
food B-positive
remains O
excellent O
. O

Run O
don't O
walk O
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

It's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O

the O

little O
on O
the O
expensive O

, O
but O
fresh O
. O

On O
weekends O

THe O
Pizza B-positive
and O

were O
excellent-the O
service B-positive
too--but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-positive
dining I-positive
area I-positive
. O

The O
mussels B-positive
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-positive
... O

are O
also O
quite O
reasonable O

Pizza B-positive

terrific O
, O
as O

the O
shellfish B-neutral

triple B-positive
color I-positive
and I-positive

Why O
? O

– O
First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
am O
not O

Long O

If O
only O
they O

make O
a O
mint O
! O

As O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four O
, O
our O
food O
was O
dropped O
off O

I O
also O
really O
enjoy O
the O
simplicity O
of O
the O
decor B-positive
and O
intimate O
feeling B-positive
of O
a O
small O

. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O

On O

our O
waitress B-negative
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O
. O

The O
bibimbap B-neutral
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone B-negative
bowl I-negative
wasn't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-positive
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O
. O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
. O

Portions B-neutral
was O
just O
enough O
for O
me O
, O
but O
may O
not O
be O
for O
a O
big O
eater O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O
( O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-negative
salad I-negative
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

Ingredients B-positive

organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
authentic O

would O
NOT O

uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up O
. O

awesome O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

Portions O
contain O
less O
fish O
than O
one O
would O
expect O
, O
particularly O
since O
prices O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
best O
sushi O
places O
in O
NYC O
( O
Masa O
excluded O

I'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-negative
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-negative
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O

get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O

Our O
server B-positive
was O
very O
professional O

seated O
near O
us O
for O
the O
first O
part O

they O
were O
replaced O
by O
a O
delightful O
preteen O
who O
pretended O
to O
gag O
every O
time O
seafood O
was O
mentioned O
at O
her O

This O
is O
some O
really O

not O

Rao B-neutral
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O

it's O
nothing O
special O

She O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O

who O
had O
flown O
off O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
but O
we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
promise O
seriously O
, O
seeing O
as O
she O
hadn't O
bothered O
to O
get O
the O
waitresses O
name O
. O

Um O
so O
now O
what O
are O
appetizers O
for O
? O
? O
? O

there O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
the O
piano O
and O
singing O
at O
the O
bar O
area O
which O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
dinning O

. O

When O
we O
finally O
were O
able O
to O
flag O
someone O
down O

it O
was O
someone O
entirely O
different O
from O
the O

dropped O
off O
the O

who O
was O
also O
not O
the O

taken O
our O

Try O
everything O

, O
it O
is O
all O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O

we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O

to O
accept O
it O

The O

Unbelievable O

A O

the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O

in O

of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-positive
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
) O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-positive
and I-positive
Hydes I-positive
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

This O
place B-negative
is O
incredibly O
tiny O

Ive O
asked O
a O

for O
a O
lotus O

The O

the O

and O
the O

the O

What O
a O
great O

The O

eat O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$ O
60 O

Without O
the O

I O
would O
probably O
go O

there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O

better O
and O
don't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O

Just O
because O
it's O

does O
NOT O
mean O
the O

the O

However O
, O
it O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-negative
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-negative
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Unless O
you O
are O
just O
stopping O
in O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B-positive
I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
going O
here O

i O

you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O

looking O
bored O

but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i'm O
here O

eat O

enjoy O
the O
company O
of O

seeking O

Big B-positive

fill O
your O

Fantastic O
! O

I O
definitely O
wouldn't O
go O
back O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-positive
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O

the O

has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O

I O
would O
never O

In O
the O

a O
well O

with O
it O

Delivery B-negative

sometimes O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-neutral
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O

Sun O

you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O

bar O
. O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O

I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky B-positive
Strike I-positive
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid-back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-negative
branzino I-negative
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

Just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

Pizza B-negative
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

Never O
too O
crowded O
and O
always O
great O
service B-positive
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-positive
chocolate B-positive
cake I-positive
, O
both O
were O
delicious O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O

the O
taste O
of O
the O

the O

the O

Amma B-neutral

nothing O
special O

Skip O
this O
restaurant B-negative
, O
it's O
a O
big O
disappointment O
. O

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B-negative
selection I-negative
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
bar B-negative
drinks I-negative
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-positive
dog I-positive
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-positive
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
, O
but O
it O
shouldn't O
. O

Try O
the O
Chef's B-positive
Choice I-positive

the O
smoked B-positive

Our O

kept O
coming O

our O
server B-negative
came O
by O
a O
couple O
times O

The O

very O
pleasant O

This O
is O
the O
case O
at O
this O
gem O

My O

settled O
for O

but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O

to O
try O
the O
dim B-neutral
sum I-neutral
, O
which O
was O
good O

not O
outstanding O

but O
good O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( O
that O
don O
’ O

, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

She O
had O
heard O
from O
a O
co-worker O
about O
this O
place O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B-positive
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor B-neutral
, O
you O
can't O
beat O
this O
place O

The O
presentation O
of O
the O
food B-positive
was O
an O
added O
bonus O
, O
it O
looked O
just O
as O
great O
as O
it O
tasted O
! O

I O
was O
frankly O
shocked O
when O
I O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
- O
this O
place B-positive
is O
fantastic O
; O
it O
has O
not O
let O
us O
down O
in O
any O
way O
, O
and O
we've O
eaten O
here O
more O
than O
10 O
times O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal O
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-positive
from O
the O
dumpling O
menu O

I O
guarantee O
you O
won't O
be O
disappointed O

there's O
also O
valet O

The O
potato B-positive
balls I-positive
were O
not O
dry O

The O
upside O

the O
restaurant O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

Good O

Maybe O
tomorrow O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

What O
may O
be O
interesting O
to O
most O
is O
the O
worst O
sevice O
/ O
attitude O
comes O
from O
the O
owners B-negative
of O
this O
establishment O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-negative
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

It's O
fresh O
, O
welcoming O
, O
delicious O
, O
and O
relaxing O

It's O
* O
very O
* O
reasonably O
priced O

for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O

Then O
, O
to O

off O

she O
dropped O

did O

clean O
the O
mess O

The O

who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you're O
* O
really O
* O
talking O
about O
. O

– O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
go O
there O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
and O
prices O
I O
saw O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

But O
if O
you're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-negative
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-positive
food I-positive

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-positive
is O
good O
. O

I O
couldn't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel O
... O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
dont O
want O
to O
miss O
, O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

If O
you're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non-intrusive O
. O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
: O
the O
manager B-negative
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
didn't O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
comp O
it O
. O

Snooze O
provided O
an O
inventive O
pancake O
offering O
, O
but O
Le O
Peep O
would O
have O
provided O
better O
service O
and O
quality O
. O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy's O
frequently O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
( O
like O
me O
) O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
( O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
) O
- O
head O
over O
to O
McDonalds O
or O
some O
Ruby O
Tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it O
! O

Great O
food B-positive
, O
good O

Always O

service B-positive
! O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-positive
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

And O
even O
with O
it's O
Pub O
atmosphere O
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O

I O
have O

MMmmm O
... O
it O

best O
chinese B-positive
food I-positive
i O
have O
tasted O
in O
a O
long O
time O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-positive
oysters I-positive
and I-positive
clams I-positive
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

The O
food B-positive
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-neutral
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

I'm O
astonished O
that O
this O
restaurant B-negative
is O
categorized O
as O
$ O
$ O
$ O
rather O
than O
$ O
$ O
$ O
. O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B-positive
. O

Before O
the O
steak O
came O
, O
the O
server O
told O
us O
that O
the O
steak O
did O
not O
come O
with O
any O
sides O
and O
suggested O
I O
pick O
something O
from O
the O
menu O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-negative
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

BTW O
, O
I O
really O
like O
Long O
Beach O
. O

Waited O
35 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
which O
was O
ok O
for O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor B-negative
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white B-positive
organza I-positive

which O
included O
a O
four B-positive

prix I-positive
fix I-positive
menu I-positive
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot O
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
place B-neutral
is O
a O
bit O
hidden O
away O
, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
there O
, O
it's O
all O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

you O
are O
with O
a O
hot O
date O
and O
he O
/ O
she O
has O
an O
urge O
for O
sushi B-positive
... O
then O
this O
might O
be O
the O
place O
. O

30 O
minutes O
went O
by O
and O
sure O
enough O
the O
pager O
buzzer O
went O
off O
. O

For O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-neutral
black I-neutral
sesame I-neutral
mousse I-neutral
( O
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
) O
and O
matcha B-positive

– O
The O

& O
the O
waiters B-negative
were O
rude O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

Not O
alot O
of O

in O
New O

, O
but O
I O
have O
found O
my O
favorite O
smoking O
balconey B-positive
in O
the O
city O
. O

Try O
sushimi B-positive
cucumber I-positive
roll I-positive
. O

DONOT O
GO O
! O

the O
turkey B-negative
burgers I-negative
are O
scary O
! O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-negative
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-positive
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

Also O
love O
their O
caeser B-positive
salad I-positive
. O

Thalia B-positive
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-positive
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-negative
doesn't O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

– O
I O
decided O
to O
eat O
at O
Stack O
because O
of O
their O
price B-neutral
fixed I-neutral
pre-show I-neutral
dinner I-neutral
. O

Open O
late O
( O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I'm O
a O
night O
person O
) O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O
Street O
, O
of O
course O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B-positive
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-positive
don't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-positive
special I-positive
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

It O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
" O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
" O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
? O
? O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-positive
wasn't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

I O
didn't O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
so O
much O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-negative
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
hostess B-negative
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

Delivery B-positive
is O
fast O
too O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

The O
veal B-positive
and O
the O
mushrooms B-positive
were O
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

Ambience B-positive
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

Service B-negative
is O
not O
what O
you O
are O
coming O
here O
for O
... O

Another O
review O
here O
claimed O
the O
pre-fix O
was O
$ O
29 O
/ O
per O
person O
including O
sake O
but O
it O
is O
$ O
55 O
per O
person O
not O
including O
sake O
. O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-negative
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
) O
. O

Best O
Indian B-positive
Restaurant I-positive
in O
the O
City O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-positive
of I-positive
wine I-positive
while O
we O
waited O
. O

– O
Where O
can O
I O
begin O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-positive
was O
special O
. O

The O
location B-neutral
and O
ambience B-neutral
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

The O
place B-positive
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

– O
we O
got O
a O
groupon O
for O
pagoda O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
on O
a O
thursday O
night O
. O

Veal O
Parmigana O
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy's O
! O

Wouldn't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner O
! O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B-negative
and O
bad O
service B-negative
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
good B-positive
and O
bad O
service B-negative
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place B-negative
is O
really O
expensive O
and O
the O
portions B-negative
are O
on O
the O
small O
side O
. O

In O
summer-eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B-positive
( O
another O
great O
feature O
of O
Suan O
) O
! O
! O
! O

This O
place B-negative
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-negative
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

Interesting O
selection B-positive
, O
good O
wines B-positive
, O
service B-positive
fine O
, O
fun O
decor B-positive
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-positive
restaurant I-positive
! O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-negative
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
. O

The O
cream B-positive
cheeses I-positive
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B-positive
! O
! O

Thank O
You O
Emilio B-positive
. O

You O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-positive
Pomodori I-positive
. O

Pacifico B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
casually O
hang O
out O
. O

I O
don't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

The O
food B-negative
is O
not O
what O
it O
once O
was O
( O
potions B-negative
have O
seriously O
seen O
downsizing O
) O
prices O
have O
gone O
up O
, O
and O
the O
service B-negative
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
experienced O
anywhere O
( O
including O
mainland O
Europe O
) O
. O

This O
place B-negative
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-positive
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-negative
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

Very O
" O
normal O
Indian B-neutral
food I-neutral
" O
, O
but O
done O
really O
well O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B-positive
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O
. O

The O
rice B-positive
to I-positive
fish I-positive
ration I-positive
was O
also O
good--they O
didn't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

Green B-positive
Tea I-positive
creme I-positive
brulee I-positive
is O
a O
must O
! O

I O
cannot O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
again O
this O
coming O
weekend O
! O

I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

– O
We O
were O
treated O
very O
rudely O
here O
one O
time O
for O
breakfast O
. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B-positive
dishes I-positive
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-positive
( I-positive
rice I-positive
porridge I-positive
) I-positive
. O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
good O
, O
I O
can't O
lie O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
homemade O
donut O
holes O
were O
served O
for O
desert O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-positive
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
can't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

Food B-neutral
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-positive
terrace I-positive
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
really O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

The O
coffe B-positive
is O
very O
good O
, O
too O
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-positive
and O
has O
great O
food B-positive
! O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-positive
. O

After O
sitting O
there O
with O
my O
empty O
glass O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
I O
left O
. O

the O
ambiance B-positive
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
nice O
and O
good O
for O
fine O
dinning O
. O

The O
restaurant B-positive
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

– O
Save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
DO O
NOT O
visit O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
all O
good O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
mild O
. O

it's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-positive
comfort I-positive

I O
thought O

just O
annoying O

I O
couldn't O

the O

courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

I'm O
sure O
I'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-positive
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho O
, O
cute O
, O
artsy O
, O
interesting O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O

the O

Service B-negative
was O
slow O

but O
the O
people B-positive
were O
friendly O
. O

I O
went O
home O
& O
looked O
them O
up O
online O
again O
where O
I O
discovered O
there O
is O
a O
link O
for O
a O
give O

that O
doesn't O
work O
so O
emailed O
the O
restaurant B-negative
about O
the O
non O
existent O
service O
& O
deceptive O
link O
. O

She O
doesn't O
make O
you O
feel O
welcome O
and O
treats O
you O
like O
an O
annoyance O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-negative
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-negative
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

less O

time O
for O
me O
! O

This O
is O
the O
first O

I've O
been O
that O
a O

remembers O
my O

hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O

a O

soooo O
good O
... O
the O
walnuts B-positive
were O
cut O
in O
smaller O
pieces O
and O
very O
crunchy O
and O
tasty O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
Snooze B-positive
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
sophisticated O
just O
for O
being O
there O
; O
but O
peel O
back O
the O
layers O
and O
you O
have O
an O

I O
never O

moved O
by O
how O

told O

in O

I O

I O

Love O
this O
place B-positive
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O

is O
one O
of O
the O

Once O

Melt O

and O
the O
atmosphere B-neutral
was O
casual O
. O

and O
you O
can't O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

Very O
Disappointing O

The O
high O
prices O
you're O
going O
to O
pay O
is O
for O
the O
view B-neutral
not O
for O
the O
food B-negative

This O
place B-positive
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

The O
place B-positive
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-positive
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O

Delicious O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B-positive
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
salads B-positive
are O
fantastic O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

The O
place B-positive
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O

During O
our O

The O
sushi B-negative
was O
awful O
! O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

Our O
server B-positive
continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue O
: O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray's B-neutral
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O
children O
for O
dinner O
? O

this O
place O
... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
all O
that O
want O

A O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager B-negative
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment--to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
" O
blown O
off O
" O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
. O

For O
my O
entrée O
, O
I O
completely O
enjoyed O
the O
seared B-positive
Alaskan I-positive
sea I-positive

complemented O
by O
chard O

artichoke O
hearts O

The O

go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-positive
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-positive
were O
great O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
aspiring O
, O
and O
the O
decor B-positive
is O
festive O
and O
amazing O
.. O

I O
can't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

Consistently O

i O
can't O
comment O
on O
their O

list O

their O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-positive
to O
people O
watch O

Service B-positive
was O
wonderful O
; O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

The O
waiter B-negative
was O
a O
bit O
unfriendly O
and O
the O
feel B-negative
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
crowded O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

Delicious O
... O
! O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

I O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker's O
Beach O
pizza O
which O
occupied O
the O
the O

years O

( O
a O

The O
outside O

We O
thought O
that O
this O

using O
too O
much O
of O

in O
the O
foods B-negative
. O

Recommendations O

of O

are O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O

is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

Yum O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B-positive

would O
get O
some O
good O

because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O

It's O
all O
about O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O
. O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

Loved O
It O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

As O
of O
writing O
this O
I O
just O
tried O
their O
give O
away O
a O
link O
again O
& O
it O
still O
doesn't O
work O
. O

We O
didn't O
want O
a O
bottle O
of O
bubbly O
on O
a O
weekday O
so O
we O
each O
got O
little O
bottles B-positive
of I-positive
Korbett I-positive
it O
was O
just O
enough O
. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B-negative
is O
the O
prices O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

we O
ordered O
the O
honey O
walnut O
prawns O
which O
we O
always O
order O
at O
every O
chinese O
restaurant O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O
of O
food O
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-negative
sauce I-negative
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
) O
, O
the O
vinegar-soaked O
rice B-negative
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
your O
money O
. O

Okay-i O
don't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

Normally O
, O
places O
ask O
how O
hot O
you O
want O
it O
, O
but O
they O
didn't O
. O

The O
appetizers B-positive
are O
also O
delicious O

I O
was O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O

up O

I O
was O
in O

Pongsri O
on O
48th O

compared O

Suan O
it O
is O
slow O

Our O
first O

was O
Tuna O

something O

It O

look O

as O
it's O
covered O
in O

ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

Somehow O
working O

not O

My O

looked O
very O
appetizing O

delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O

This O

HIGHLY O

We O
ordered O
the O
marinated O

the O

The O

Sometimes O
tables O
don't O
understand O
his O

it's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O

who O
has O
personality O

, O
and O
respects O
the O

of O
your O

the O
all-u-can-eat B-negative
sushi I-negative
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

My O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces B-negative
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

They O
aren't O
the O
most O
talkative O
, O
but O
everytime O
I've O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy O
, O
which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation O
. O

Their O
calzones B-negative
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit-inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-positive

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor's O
idea O
of O

must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait B-neutral
, O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O

I O

The O

the O

not O

The O

the O

the O

HORRID O

We O
recently O

to O
our O
delight O

they O
have O
outdoor B-positive

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
" O
oh O
well O

I O
wish O
you O
would O

said O
something O

about O
this O

and O
I O
can't O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
several O
visits O

I'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off O
.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O

The O

be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O

overall O
the O
restaurant B-positive
is O
a O
must O
! O

The O
service B-negative
ranges O
from O
mediocre O
to O
offensive O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-positive
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O

If O

The O

came O
to O
the O
table O

we O
will O
visit O
the O

The O
food B-negative
however O
, O

When O
the O

nothing O
was O
comped O

so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O

I O
made O
my O
1st O
trip O
to O
the O
restaurant O
after O
finding O
their O
webpage O
online O
. O

The O
food B-negative
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

Just O
go O
there O
and O
see O
for O
yourself O

My O
quesadilla B-negative
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three-year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O
. O

– O
This O
was O
great O
dining O
experience O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao's B-positive
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O

– O
Love O
their O

the O

surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

Highly O
recommended O

all O
! O

The O
hostess B-negative
and O
the O
waitress B-negative
were O
incredibly O
rude O

did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O

out O

The O
staff B-positive
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-positive
is O
lovely O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

The O
owners B-positive
are O
great O
fun O
and O
the O
beer B-positive
selection I-positive
is O
worth O
staying O
for O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-positive
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-negative
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O

if O
it's O

, O
you O

this O

The O

it O

but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-neutral
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O

their O
Grilled B-positive

special I-positive
with I-positive
Edamame I-positive
Puree I-positive
. O

Great O
atmoshere B-positive
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

Ravioli B-positive
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

The O
chicken B-positive
lollipop I-positive
is O
my O
favorite O
, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-negative
( O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
) O
are O
quite O
oily O
and O
very O
spicy O
, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli B-negative
Chicken I-negative
. O

had O
many O
dishes O
but O
the O
BEST O
was O
the O
lobster B-positive
3 I-positive

. O

The O
staff B-positive
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O

. O

First O
off O
, O
the O
food O
came O
fast O
and O
all O
together O
:) O
i O
like O
that O
... O
i O
hate O
the O
pretentiousness O
of O
things O
coming O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

The O
restaurant B-neutral
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-positive

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

The O
food B-positive

so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-positive

nice O
. O

the O
drinks B-positive

amazing O

8p O

delicious O
bagels B-positive
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O

The O
space B-negative
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O

setting O
, O
without O
it O
trying O
to O
be O
that O
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you're O

waste O
my O

rather O
go O
across O
the O

to O
Tamari O

The O
service B-positive
was O
attentive O
. O

Food B-positive
is O
usually O
very O
good O

though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-negative

Wine B-positive
list I-positive
selection I-positive

wine-by-the-glass B-positive

filled O

the O

We O
will O
be O
back O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal B-positive

The O

complimented O
the O

very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O

Mioposto's O

6pm O

we O

A O

Polite O

out O

The O
filet B-positive

dish I-positive
was O
superb O

The O
service B-negative
is O
awful O
. O

also O
it's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B-positive
, O
the O
service B-positive
it's O
just O
perfect O
... O
they're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O
! O

The O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

But O
the O
servers B-positive
were O
extremely O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly O
. O

The O
place B-positive
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-positive
scene I-positive
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

Its O
location B-positive
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-positive
again O
and O
again O
. O

It O
is O
so O
romantic O
. O

Can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B-negative
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-positive
to O
the O
food B-positive
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
the O
owner B-negative
was O
seated O
right O
next O
to O
us O
and O
when O
he O
came O
over O
to O
check O
on O
our O
problems O
was O
very O
dismissive O
and O
offered O
a O
token O
20 O
% O
discount O
on O
our O
bill O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye-pleasing O
with O
several O
semi-private B-positive
boths I-positive
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-positive
. O

This O
place B-positive
blew O
me O
away O
... O
by O
far O
my O
new O
favorite O
restaurant O
on O
the O
uppereast O
side O
. O

The O
service B-negative
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O
and O
helpful O
. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

The O
desert B-positive
was O
the O
perfect O
ending O
to O
an O
almost O
perfect O
dinner B-positive
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
’ I-positive
s I-positive
are O
light O
and O
scrumptious O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-negative
said O
, O
" O
can O
I O
help O
you O
" O
and O
" O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
" O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/2 O
to O
make O
it O
. O

It's O
a O
great O
little O
place B-positive
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service B-negative
weren't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like O
. O

The O
tables B-negative
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-neutral
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-negative
list I-negative
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

I'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O
Francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like O
. O

With O
so O
many O
great O
breakfast O
/ O
lunch O
places O
in O
So O
Cal O
, O
this O
one O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
any O
extra O
effort O
to O
visit O
. O

Try O
the O
sea B-positive

Excellent O
food B-positive
, O
nice O
ambience B-positive
, O
fairly O
expensive O

It's O
located O
in O
a O
strip O
mall O
near O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
location B-neutral
, O
but O
the O
food B-positive
keeps O
me O
coming O
back O
for O
more O
. O

– O
I've O
been O
to O
Open B-positive
Sesame I-positive
only O
once O
, O
but O
I'm O
still O
reeling O
from O
the O
experience O
! O
! O

We O
were O
then O
charged O
for O
their O
most O
expensive O
sake O
( O
$ O
20 O
+ O
per O
serving O
) O
when O
we O
in O
fact O
drank O
a O
sake O
of O
less O
than O
half O
that O
price O
. O

but O
ive O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
yrs O
and O
finally O
decided O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-positive
and O
terrific O
food B-positive

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O

I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O

Try O
the O
Pad B-positive
Thai I-positive
, O
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B-positive
menu I-positive
... O
they're O
all O
delicious O

We O
thought O
the O
dessert B-negative
would O
be O
better O
, O
Wrong O
! O

great O
toppings B-positive
definitely O
a O
place B-positive
you O
need O
to O
check O
out O
for O
late O
night O
munchies O
or O
a O
mid O
day O
boost O

– O
The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
great O
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
you O
might O
want O
to O
celebrate O
. O

Ray's O
is O
something O
of O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
, O
but O
given O
its O
gorgeous O
Sound B-positive
views I-positive
, O
I O
had O
suspected O
that O
the O
accolades O
were O
more O
due O
to O
the O
scenery O
than O
to O
the O
food O
and O
service O
. O

We O
had O
half B-positive
/ I-positive
half I-positive
pizza I-positive
, O
mine O
was O
eggplant O
and O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
buffalo O
and O
it O
was O
sooo O
huge O
for O
a O
small O
size O
pizza O
! O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Food B-positive
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
. O

The O
only O
positive O
thing O
about O
Mioposto B-negative
is O
the O
nice O
location B-positive
. O

Stay O
away O

Best O
. O
Sushi B-positive
. O
Ever O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service B-negative
was O
so O
poor O
that O
the O
food O
was O
cold O
buy O
the O
time O
everyone O
in O
my O
party O
was O
served O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B-positive
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-negative
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

I O
CAN O
EAT O
HERE O
EVERY O
DAY O
OF O
THE O
WEEK O

We O
waited O
at O
the O

had O
martinis B-positive

The O

the O

the O

This O

and O
the O
waiting B-positive
staff I-positive
has O
been O
perfect O
every O

time O
we've O

The O
ambience B-positive
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
really O
tasty O

A O

roast B-negative
pork I-negative

egg B-negative

awesome O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY--I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-positive
special I-positive
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-positive
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
top-notch O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

Trust O
me O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-negative
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

This O
is O
sad O
for O
what O
once O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
you O
could O
ever O
eat O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-positive
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-positive
, O
chai B-positive
, O
and O
the O
chole B-positive
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-negative
and O
dhal B-negative
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-positive
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
steak B-positive
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact O
liking O
( O
medium O
rare O
) O
and O
was O
nice O
and O
juicy O
. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

enough O
said O
! O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-negative
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don't O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-positive
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-neutral
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

The O
Caesar B-negative
salad I-negative
I O
ordered O
had O
so O
much O
lemon O
I O
couldn't O
eat O
it O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O

and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O

The O
nakgi-bokum B-negative
was O
horrible O
. O

Hands O
down O
the O
best O
pizza B-positive
on O
the O
planet O

She O
replied O
" O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O

and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O

" O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-negative
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

You O
can O
order O
to O
go O
if O
you O
have O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
office O
too O

I O
have O
been O
living O
in O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

The O
counter B-negative
service I-negative
is O
bad O
. O

The O
scallion B-neutral
pancakes I-neutral
and O
fried B-neutral
dumplings I-neutral
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

It's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-negative
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
... O
the O
tuna B-negative
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-negative
had O
no O
flavor O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date O
spot O
for O
Williamsburg O
couples O

– O
The O
sushi B-positive
here O
is O
perfectly O
good O
, O
but O
for O
$ O
5 O
a O
piece O
, O
either O
the O
slices O
of O
fish O
should O
be O
larger O
, O
or O
there O
should O
be O
no O
pretense O
that O
this O
is O
a O
moderately O
priced O
restaurant B-negative
( O
even O
for O
NYC O
) O

The O
best O

are O
the O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

None O
that O
I O
can O
think O
of O

plenty O
of O
food B-positive
, O
trust O
me O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
band B-positive
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
attentive O
. O

Much O
more O
than O
just O
a O
great O
view B-positive
! O

My O
bf O
and O
I O
go O
to O
the O
walk-up O
counter O
and O
order O
a O

We O
ordered O
the O

were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken O

all O
dark O

boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that's O
the O
cheff B-positive
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

You'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
don't O
compare O
. O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-negative
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
, O
the O
coffee B-positive
was O
good O
even O
by O
starbucks O
standards O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
outstanding O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-negative
and I-negative
chips I-negative
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-positive
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

Mama O
Mia O
– O
I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
feel O
lucky O
to O
live O
by O
such O
a O
great O
pizza B-positive
place I-positive
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor B-positive
, O
good O
service B-positive
, O
but O
the O
food B-positive
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

even O
the O
wine B-positive
by I-positive
the I-positive
glass I-positive
was O
good O
. O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-positive
Hand I-positive
roll I-positive
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

delicious O
simple O
food B-positive
in O
nice O
outdoor B-positive
atmosphere I-positive
. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

– O
Mercedes O
restaurant O
is O
so O
tasty O
, O
the O
service B-positive
is O
undeniably O
awesome O
! O

The O
food B-positive
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-positive
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

They O
are O
not O
greasy O
or O
anything O
. O

Impressed O
... O

Kudos O
to O
these O
guys O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-positive
mozzarella I-positive
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
place B-positive
kicks O
ass O
. O

Service B-neutral
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-positive
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

When O
you're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-positive
dining I-positive
room I-positive
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand-painted O
high O
ceiling B-positive
) O
you'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

The O
flavors O
were O
good O
but O
I O
have O
had O
far O
better O
pancakes O
at O
a O
German O
pancake O
specialty O
restaurant O
that O
were O
a O
little O
cheaper O
but O
significantly O
larger O
. O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
lobster B-positive
roll I-positive
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B-positive
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-positive
steak I-positive
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-positive
and O
great O
service B-positive
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-positive
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

Not O
a O
great O
place B-negative
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B-negative
service I-negative
. O

– O
A O
group O
of O
5 O
of O
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch O
and O
sat O
outside O
. O

No O
Comparison O

My O
g O
/ O
f O
and O
I O
both O
agreed O
the O
food B-negative
was O
very O
mediocre O
especially O
considering O
the O
price O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

The O
chips B-positive
and I-positive
salsa I-positive
are O
so O
yummy O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
fabulous O
. O

Wait B-negative
staff I-negative
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B-positive
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
good O
too O
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
, O
servers B-positive
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

The O
buffet B-positive
had O
a O
nice O
selection O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
outrageous O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
food O
was O
actually O
less O
satisfying O
than O
most O
neighborhood O
Chinese O
establishments O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O

The O
porcini B-negative
mushroom I-negative
pasta I-negative
special I-negative
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-negative
tagliatelle I-negative
. O

The O
dinner B-negative
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

$ O
6 O
with O
tip O
. O

I O
went O
here O
on O
a O
recommendation O
and O
will O
surely O
return O
time O
and O
time O
again O
. O

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here O
. O

The O
seafood B-positive
is O
amazing O
, O
there's O
a O
good O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu B-positive
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

Never O
had O
one O
single O
problem O
there O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-positive
, O
drinks B-positive
, O
and O
atmosphere B-positive
! O

The O
sommelier B-positive
is O
fantastic O
, O
down-to-earth O
, O
& O
extremely O
knowlegable O
. O

Will O
prob O
. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
. O

the O
waitstaffs B-positive
are O
nice O
though O
. O

You O
routinely O
see O
Indian O
families O
and O
friends O
dining O
there O
, O
which O
is O
always O
a O
good O
sign O
. O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing--I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-negative
. O

its O
alright O

Rude O
service B-negative
, O
medicore O
food B-neutral
... O
there O
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NY O
... O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
one O

Great O
place B-positive
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
your O
dinner O

One O
special B-positive
roll I-positive
and O
one O
regular B-positive
roll I-positive
is O
enough O
to O
fill O
you O
up O
, O
but O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B-positive
! O

Way O
below O
average O

The O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

The O
pasta B-positive
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
didn't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar B-negative
keep I-negative
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
& O
kept O
telling O
us O
she'd O
be O
right O
with O
us O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak O
, O
medium O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-negative
! O

Excellent O
spot B-positive
for O
holiday O
get O
togethers O
with O
co-workers O
or O
friends O
that O
you O
haven't O
seen O
in O
a O
while O
. O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B-negative
bathroom I-negative
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

There O
were O
3 O
bottles O
of O
perfume O
on O
the O
sink O
and O
the O
line O
of O
girls O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
sink O
. O

We O
used O
to O
frequent O
most O
of O
their O
restaurants O
but O
over O
the O
years O
each O
one O
has O
really O
been O
disapointing O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O
) O

We O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
requested O
the O
special O
dinner O
, O
which O
came O
with O
: O
1 O
) O
Shellfish O
and O
Shrimp O

Gorgeous O
place B-positive
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B-negative
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
) O
. O

I O
have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O
attendant O
in O
the O
restroom B-negative
which O
was O
odd O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
place B-negative
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

Good O
drink B-positive
. O

It O
wasn't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-negative
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

The O
restaurant O
offers O
an O
extensive O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
and O
an O
ambiance B-positive
you O
won't O
forget O
! O

The O
main B-positive
entree I-positive
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

those O
rolls B-neutral
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-negative
wasn't O
fresh O
. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
. O

The O
lobster B-positive
sandwich I-positive
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

The O
lava B-positive
cake I-positive
dessert I-positive
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-negative
fair I-negative
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it's O
your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-negative
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

But O
that O
wasn't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B-negative
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
appetizer B-positive
was O
interesting O
, O
but O
the O
Creme B-positive
Brulee I-positive
was O
very O
savory O
and O
delicious O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

But O
nonetheless--great O
spot B-positive
, O
great O
food B-positive
. O

This O
dish B-positive
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

Don't O
miss O
Bloom's B-positive
on O
your O
next O
trip O
to O
Manhatten O
. O

Great O
survice B-positive

Staff B-positive
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

This O
is O
the O
MOST O
wonderful O
restaurant B-positive
in O
all O
of O
New O
York O
City O
, O
not O
just O
Brooklyn O
... O

Mmm O
... O
good O
! O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-positive
. O

– O
i O
have O
been O
eating O
at O
this O
place O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
now O
and O
i O
have O
never O
had O
one O
bad O
meal B-positive
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-positive
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-negative
. O

I O
picked O
the O
asparagus B-positive
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
incredible O
and O
perfectly O
prepared O
. O

Southglenn O
is O
largest O
location O
. O

It's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

A O
beautifully O
designed O
dreamy O
Egyptian B-positive
restaurant I-positive
that O
gets O
sceney O
at O
night O
. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O
. O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

– O
they O
have O
4 O
locations O
. O

Expensive O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-positive
here O
. O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-negative
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un-appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-negative
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-positive
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

Check O
out O
the O
art B-positive
on I-positive
the I-positive
walls I-positive
, O
very O
colorful O
! O

I O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B-positive
is O
def O
worth O
commending O
! O

The O
manager B-negative
continually O
interrupted O
with O
" O
Is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
do O
for O
you O
? O
" O
, O
a O
strange O
comment O
because O
she O
had O
hardly O
listened O
, O
let O
alone O
responded O
to O
our O
expression O
of O
disappointment O
at O
our O
experience O

How O
to O
describe O
the O
best O
sushi B-positive
in O
NYC O
: O
hmmmm O

delicious O
, O
amazing O
, O
fantastic O
, O
suculent O

perfect O

nah O

all O
of O

I O
think O
I've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-positive
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

I'm O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
Southend O
resident O
and O
was O
excited O
to O
hear O
of O
this O
restaurant O
opening O
. O

Nice O
ambience B-positive
, O
but O
highly O
overrated O
place B-negative
. O

It's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-positive
in O
NYC O
. O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
don't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O

Breakfast B-positive

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O
barnyard O
sweepstakes O
, O
Flatbush O
Farm O
isn't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

– O
Thats O
a O
big O
statement O
considering O
I've O
been O
pulling O
crab O
traps O
and O
making O
the O
cakes B-positive
myself O
since O
I O
was O
about O
seven O
- O
but O
something O
about O
these O
little O
devils O
gets O
better O
every O
time O
. O

Great O
wine B-positive
selection I-positive
, O
Gigondas B-positive
is O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house B-positive
champagne I-positive
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

Regardless O
, O
we'll O
be O
back O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-positive
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-positive
and O
atmosphere B-positive
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-negative
and O
service B-negative
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

Untill O
this O
happens O
, O
my O
advice O
is O
to O
STAY O
AWAY O
. O

Good O

Don't O
waste O
money O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O

There O
have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we've O
just O
not O
gotten O
some O
side O
dishes O
we've O
ordered O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

Nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding O
. O

We O
didn't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O

Highly O
recommend O
it O

Always O

The O

probably O
the O
best O
that O
I've O
had O
at O
this O

It O
was O
wonderful O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O

and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-negative

it O
gets O
really O
busy O
, O
so O
get O
there O
on O
the O
early O
side O
so O
you O
can O
grab O
a O
seat O
, O
if O
you O
do O
have O
to O
wait O

its O
not O
bad O
because O
the O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-positive
patio I-positive
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-positive
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O

the O
bartenders B-positive
go O

You O
can O
get O

the O

– O
My O
first O

to O
dine O
at O
this O

it O
was O
absolutely O
horrible O

Great O

No O

The O
food B-negative

a O

I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
going O

The O

sinful O

So O
, O
if O
you're O
walking O
by O

thinking O
about O

you O
might O
want O
to O
see O

you O

they O
were O
dry O

Service B-negative

not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-positive
tuna I-positive

it O
is O
to O
die O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O

arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O

and O
the O
staff B-negative
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

The O
fried B-positive
dumplings I-positive
are O
GREAT O
! O

Inexpensive O
, O
unassuming O
, O
great O
time O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O

you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O

still O
keep O

Indo B-positive
Chinese I-positive

pretty O
good O

upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
amazing O
! O

The O
pizza B-negative
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-positive
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

If O
you O
go O

try O
the O
marinara B-positive

arrabiatta I-positive
sauce I-positive

the O

Carozza I-positive
is O

everything O
is O
just O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O

but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-positive
and O
crab B-positive
salad I-positive
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

The O
drinks B-positive
are O
great O
, O
especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond B-positive
. O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual O
. O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-positive
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-negative
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O

I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-positive
Saul I-positive

Smith O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O

It O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

I O
come O
here O
enjoy O
very O
much O
with O
husband O
. O

The O
servers B-negative
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
take O
out O
from O
here O
3-4 O
times O
a O
month O
. O

Mussles B-positive

calamari B-positive
were O
superb O
Saturday O

As O
usual O
the O
omikase B-positive
didn't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O

although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O

selection O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well O
. O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-negative
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

The O
sushi B-positive
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
wait B-positive
staff I-positive
was O
quick O

Hampton O
Chutney O
Co O

does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O

offer O
more O
style O

substance O

but O
in O
this O
unattractive O

there O
was O
a O

( O
i O
hang O

the O
hot B-positive
dogs I-positive
were O
juicy O
and O
tender O
inside O
and O
had O
plenty O
of O
crunch O
and O
snap O
on O
the O

The O
music B-positive

no O

the O

The O

well O
, O
i O
didn't O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-positive
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

The O
sashimi B-positive
was O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
tender O
I O
have O
ever O
tasted O
. O

So O
for O
the O
' O
after O
beach O
excursion O
' O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
. O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I'm O
eating O
indian B-positive
cuisine I-positive
. O

While O
this O
diner O
had O
reasonably O
good O
food B-positive
, O
the O
restaurant B-negative
staff I-negative
seemed O
completely O
indifferent O
to O
our O
presence O
, O
and O
this O
attitude O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
service O
. O

We O
were O
4 O
and O
got O
the O
family O
size O
penne B-positive
a I-positive
la I-positive
vodka I-positive
which O
was O
tremendously O
gigantic O
portion O
... O
a O
bucket O
of O
food O
literally O
. O

The O
waiter B-positive
was O
attentive O
. O

Although O
the O
service B-negative
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in O
. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
sat O
. O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O
. O

The O
freshest O
, O
best O

and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-positive

The O

Food B-positive
was O
good O
and O
cheap O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

I O
can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

The O

very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
phenomenal O
! O

All O
considered O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Ray's B-positive
Boathouse I-positive
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
place O
is O
the O
next O
best O
thing O
to O
my O
Moms O
cooking O
. O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian B-positive
place I-positive
! O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service B-positive
impecible O

magnificant O
. O

I O
have O
been O

Guacamole B-positive

appetizer I-positive
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-positive

very O
good O
, O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O

that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
! O

Good O

about O
12 O
minutes O
, O
the O

If O
the O

The O
setting B-positive
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-positive
is O
great O
. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
don't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O

Some O

I've O
never O
ordered O
anything O

from O
their O
menu O
... O
there's O
no O

Quite O
simply O
it's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

The O
veal B-positive
was O
incredible O

A O
weakness O

Not O

I O
called O
the O

Yes O

I O
ate O

I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O

I O
was O
at O

fairly O
sick O

my O

The O

The O

Space B-negative

the O

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

Authentic O
Taiwanese B-positive
food I-positive
that's O
cheap O
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

They O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
tall O
, O
skinny O
hour-glass O
shaped O
glass O
to O
disguise O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
a O
getting O
a O
small O
juice B-negative
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
half O
gallon O
in O
a O
supermarket O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-positive
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
O O
. O
G O
. O
again O
last O
night O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Kafta B-positive
plate I-positive
and O
it O
was O
perfect O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza O
here O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-positive
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-positive
soon O
! O

This O
place B-positive
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-negative
. O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O

promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O

give O
it O
a O

one O

Once O
seated O
it O
took O
about O
30 O
minutes O
to O
finally O
get O
the O
meal O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-positive

which O
is O
out O

and O
the O

If O
you O

I O
took O
my O

i O
would O
say O
that O
i O

7 O
to O

horrible O

A O

I O
never O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O

Awesome O

I O
just O
found O
out O
that O
you O
can O
have O
the O
place B-positive
to O
yourself O
on O
nights O
and O
weekends O
for O
a O
private O
party O
- O
can't O
wait O
to O
celebrate O
my O

This O
place B-neutral

always O
packed O

Delivery B-negative

Eating O

saves O
it O

but O
at O
your O

it's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O

the O
Beverly O

We O
replied O
that O
we O

If O

We O
are O
locals O

get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place B-negative
survives O
with O
such O
average O
food B-negative
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one-time O
customer O
tourists O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-negative
didn't O
have O
my O

AMAZING O
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

The O
sandwiches B-negative
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-negative
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-positive

become O
overcrowded O

Got O

So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
my O
wife O

I O
don't O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O

I O
doubt O
I'll O
ever O
go O
back O

I O
loved O
it O

would O
HIGHLY O

I O
can't O
believe O
Murphy's B-positive
has O
been O
around O

over O
25 O
years O

amazing O

But O
Im O
sure O
this O
was O
just O
an O

No O
gimmicks O

whoever O

Ess-A-Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty-town O

is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B-positive
in O
NY O

Drinks B-positive

feel O
like O
I O
am O
in O

Third O

when O
I O

Yes O
, O
they O

even O
fancy O

don't O
make O
for O

Best O

Whether O
it's O
the O
parmesean B-positive
porcini I-positive
souffle I-positive
or O
the O
lamb B-positive
glazed I-positive
with I-positive
balsamic I-positive
vinegar I-positive
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
good O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-positive
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-negative
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

great O
service B-positive
. O

The O
scallops B-positive
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
) O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
personally O
wasn't O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
portobello B-negative
and I-negative
asparagus I-negative
mole I-negative
. O

It O
wasn't O
the O
freshest O
seafood B-neutral
ever O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
OK O
. O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
probably O
tried O
each O
item O
on O
their O
menu B-positive
at O
least O
once O
it O
is O
all O
excellent O
. O

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O
stars O

Unhygienic O

We O
have O
been O

many O
times O

always O
have O
great O
food B-positive

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O

grew O
up O
on O

Just O
remember O
to O
dress O
a O
little O
urban-chic O
so O
you O
don O
? O
t O
look O
too O
far O
out O
of O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-negative
listed O
off O
several O

did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O

cost O

Fresh O

everything O
is O

COMPLETELY O

pretty O
nice O

had O
a O

of O

trust O
me O

they O
will O
charge O

so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
" O
I've O

have O

three O

have O
found O
the O
quality O

variety O
of O
the O
fish B-positive
to O
be O
excellent O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O

But O
the O
staff B-negative
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

the O
fish B-positive
was O
fresh O
, O
though O
it O
was O
cut O
very O
thin O

Delicious O
, O
creative O
and O
fun O
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O

Highly O
recommended O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O

we O
were O
both O
very O
impressed O

A O
classic O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O

SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
it's O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff B-negative
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
great O

My O

to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O

Brooklyn O
. O

Mermaid B-positive
Inn I-positive
is O
an O
overall O
good O

with O
really O
good O
seafood B-positive

Even O
the O

I O
normally O

The O

to O
find O
another O

that O
serves O
up O
more O
inventive O
yet O
delicious O
japanese B-positive
food I-positive

The O
ambience B-positive
is O
pretty O

nice O

so O
a O
casual O

here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O

Decor B-positive

Parking O

reasonably O
good O

they O
have O
their O

you O
can O
park O
in O

I O
generally O
like O
this O

Great O

Took O
forever O
to O
get O
our O
order O
taken O
, O
water O
refills O
were O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
for O
and O
the O
only O
time O
she O
was O
fast O
was O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
our O
bill O
when O
we O
could O
get O
her O
attention O

I O
felt O
ackward O
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O

Very O
disappointed O

There O
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O

and O
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O

? O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-positive
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O

Service B-neutral
was O
decent O

The O
fish B-negative
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-negative
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-negative
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O

are O
outta O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-positive
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O

Oh O
I O
forgot O

everything O
from O
miso B-positive

This O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
local O
... O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

This O
place O
was O
reccomended O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend O

The O
two O
star O

left O
quite O
some O
time O

to O
open O

Fish B-positive
is O
so O
very O
fresh O

I'm O
a O

I O
wouldn't O

2 O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-positive
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
return O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-positive
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

Maybe O
I'll O
go O
back O
once O
more O
many O
years O
from O
now O
when O
I've O
forgotten O
I O
went O
there O
already O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O

I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B-positive
Salmon I-positive
, O
Sea B-positive
Bass I-positive
and O
Crispy B-positive
Duck I-positive

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-positive
Black I-positive
Cod I-positive
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-positive
Salmon I-positive
dish I-positive
was O
better O
. O

This O
place B-positive
rocks O
! O
! O

Not O
only O
can O
the O
selection B-positive
be O
innovative O
, O
but O
there's O
a O
nice O
balance O
of O
traditional O
sushi B-positive
as O
well O
. O

It's O

the O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-positive
England I-positive
Chowder I-positive
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-positive
Bisque I-positive

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B-positive

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O

The O

pretty O
friendly O

Late O

After O
hearing O
a O

of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

The O
food B-negative
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

And O
I've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
quick O
. O

Entrees O
: O
Vanison O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria B-positive
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
banana O
tempura O
for O
dessert B-negative
and O
they O
dont O
have O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-negative
is O
slow O
and O
they O
don't O
toast O
! O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-negative
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
I've O
had O
better O
frozen O
pizza B-negative
. O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-positive
teriyaki I-positive
and O
the O
rose B-positive
special I-positive
roll I-positive
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
... O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-positive
. O

The O
space B-negative
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
was O

make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B-negative

Had O
to O
wait O

to O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O

even O
she O
( O
